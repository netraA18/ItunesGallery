# ItunesGallery

This project was developed as part of my coursework for CSCI 1302 (Software Development) at the University of Georgia. It is an iTunes gallery app created using JavaFX. Due to university policies, I'm unable to share the code publicly, but you can see a demonstration of the app running below.
